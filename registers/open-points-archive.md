# Open points — archive

Settled questions, with the answer and the evidence. Kept because in a few weeks
several of these will look reopenable and they are not.

---

## A-01 · What is the player? — **settled**

A fading old power that walks among people, seen by fewer of them as the world
gets louder; eventually confined. Long-lived, not immortal in effect.

This resolved a great deal downstream at once: presence became *spatial* rather
than a budget, delegates became *the people who can still perceive you*, and
temples became life support rather than memorials.

## A-02 · What is the scarce resource? — **settled**

Position. Not attention, not mana. Where you are standing, and what ground you can
enter.

## A-03 · Is attention a viable currency? — **settled: no**

Playtested in the first prototype. Attention is *subtractive* — you start each
turn with six and spend to zero, nothing accumulates, and there is no surplus with
which to plan. Every decision is a denial. It produced a triage game, which is a
real genre and not the one wanted.

## A-04 · Should there be a combat system? — **settled: no**

Conflict resolves through ground, cult, and marching. An army arrives or it is
walled out. No units, no tiles-of-battle, no resolution table. Nothing has been
lost by this.

## A-05 · How big should the map be? — **settled: small**

Measured. At 18 × 11 (198 tiles) the Cities strategy scored 122.3 against a rival
that did nothing and 121.8 against one playing optimally — **0% interference**. Two
solitaires on a shared board. At 14 × 9 (126 tiles) interference is 31–39%.

Crowding is what makes it a game. This is the single most important measured
result in the project.

## A-06 · Can destruction be an action? — **settled: no, it needs its own slot**

Every version of a destructive action tested made the magical player *lose* —
between 0% and 15% win rates. The cause is action economy, not damage: blessing is
worth ~21 points a turn, and spending your one action on anything else is losing.
Splitting act and intervention into two slots fixed it immediately.

## A-07 · Are sacred stones weapons? — **settled: no, engines**

As active weapons, they made the magical side worse (54% → 2%). As passive
engines that bless without costing an action, they work — because they are the only
compounding thing the magical side has, and cities compound by default.

## A-08 · Does damaging population work as an attack? — **settled: no**

Population regrows exponentially. Knocking a town from 200 to 100 costs the owner
about four years and costs the attacker permanent board position. Damage that heals
is worthless against a compounding engine. Attacks have to take *ground* or take
*the settlement*.

## A-09 · What are the scoring values? — **settled**

Blessed 3, reckoned 2, settlement 3. At blessed=1 the Cities strategy won 98–100%
of all games. Raising blessed to 3 was the single change that made the magical path
exist at all.

## A-10 · Should magic decay on a timer? — **settled: no**

Replaced with the paired exchange — each thing gained silences a specific thing
lost, priced and visible before you commit. A timer is weather; an exchange is a
decision. Same arc, completely different feeling.

## A-11 · Should causality be randomised between campaigns? — **settled: no**

Randomising what causes the fading makes player theories untestable and degrades
into arbitrariness by the fifth playthrough. Fixed laws, varied initial conditions —
which is what makes Civ replayable. Randomise the surface, never the physics.

## A-12 · Terminology for the two ground states — **settled**

*Haunted* → *thin* → **blessed**, and *cultured* → **reckoned**. "Haunted" implied
malevolence; the player is not a malevolence. "Reckoned" carries counted, surveyed,
measured, known — which is exactly what silences the ground.

## A-13 · Do the works need a price? — **settled: yes, in people**

Without population costs, granting civic interventions swung Cities from 45% to
82–90%. With costs (10% / 33% / 45%) the whole field sits within sixteen points.

## A-14 · Does a settlement's reckoning need a cap? — **settled: yes**

A settlement's reckoning radius grows with population, making its output quadratic
in time while blessing is linear. Over 20 turns survivable; over 40 decisive. At 40
turns *nothing else* balanced — every growth rate, every stone configuration, every
strike strength failed. A lifetime budget was the only fix.

## A-15 · Epochs, dealt empires, LLM delegates — **settled: out**
